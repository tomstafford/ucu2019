## Why We Are Striking

There are two disputes in the current strikes. Some universities are striking over both, some over just one.


### Dispute 1: Pensions

This was the subject of the [2018 strike](https://tomstafford.github.io/ucu-strike/). At root, staff feel that their pension fund is being mismanaged and they are being unfairly deprived of benefits they were promised.

### Dispute 2: Pay & Equalities

There are four elements to this dispute

1. **Pay**: UCU members have had a (https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10342/Value-of-university-staff-pay-has-plummeted-in-last-decade-employers-own-research-reveals)[real-terms pay cut of nearly 20% over the last 10 years]
2. **Workload**: At the same time, we are being asked to do (http://idiolect.org.uk/notes/?p=6285)[more and more work]
3. **Casualisation**: This work is increasingly done by people on (https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/29/temporary-work-lecturers-balloting-strike-uk-academics-short-term-contracts)[temporary contracts]
4. **Gender inequality**: Doing more work for less pay under more stressful conditions disproportunately (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/gender-pay-gap-uk-universities-report-slow-progress)[affects women] and (https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/07/university-staff-dont-want-to-strike-for-fair-pensions-and-pay-but-were-being-forced-to?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)[BAME staff]
