## Why We Are Striking

There are two disputes in the current strikes. Some universities are striking over both, some over just one.


### Dispute 1: Pensions

This was the subject of the [2018 strike](https://tomstafford.github.io/ucu-strike/). At root, staff feel that their pension fund is being mismanaged and they are being unfairly deprived of benefits their were promised.

### Dispute 2: Pay & Equalities

There are four elements to this dispute

1. **Pay**: UCU members have had a real-terms pay cut of nearly 20% over the last 10 years
2. **Workload**: At the same time, we are being asked to do more and more work
3. **Casualisation**: This work is increasingly done by people on temporary contracts
4. **Gender inequality**: Doing more work for less pay under more stressful conditions disproportunately affects women and BAME staff
