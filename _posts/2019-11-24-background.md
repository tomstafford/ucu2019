## How did we get here?

The context for the current disputes is the [marketisation of higher education in the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVpMgJKQkUo) that has accelerated over the last decade. Historically, the UK University system has been world-leading: setting standards in education and research which were emulated around the world, and at comparatively little cost.

The last decade has seen staff being paid less, both in real terms and as a percentage of University spending, while at the same time being asked to do more and more. The funny thing about higher education is that because the outputs are intangible - deep research, quality education - staff have been able to absorb unrealistic demands for a long time. Either we've cut corners, investing less in the scholarship and care which sustains university level research and teaching, or we've got used to working beyond our contracted hours (with the consequent [cost to personal well being](http://idiolect.org.uk/notes/?p=6285)).

The extent to which Universities rely on the goodwill of staff is made apparent by the threat of 'Action Short of A Strike' (ASOS), which is due to begin after the all-out strike action 25th November - 4th December. The idea here is that staff will work "to contact", only putting in their agreed number of hours per week. The fact that some Universities are so panicked by this that they have threatened to dock staff 100% of their pay if they work a full working week (but no more) is revealing. It shows that the current situation is only possible because staff go above and beyond what they are paid for as a matter of course.

University staff have acted as shock absorbers for the disruption of the higher education sector. Because we believe in the collective value of Universities we have put up with more work, less pay and ongoing inequalities and injustices. But the situation is untenable, if we don't do something Universities will be irreparably damaged, to the detriment of all staff, all students, the UK economy and the public sphere in general.

The current strikes were a long time coming. We are in a completely foreseeable situation which Universities could have worked much harder to avoid. Why didn't they?
